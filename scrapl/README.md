`scrapl` is a Python package for efficient evaluation of multivariable scattering transforms, specifically designed for use as a differentiable loss function in machine learning applications and perceptual quality assessment of deep inverse problems in computer vision, speech, and audio processing. 
It implements the "Scattering Transform with Random Paths for Machine Learning" (SCRAPL) algorithm, which accelerates gradient-based optimization of neural networks with scattering transforms by stochastically sampling scattering paths to approximate the full transform's gradient.
This reduces the computational and memory costs by one to three orders of magnitude. 
SCRAPL also leverages specialized stochastic optimization techniques ($\mathcal{P}$-Adam, $\mathcal{P}$-SAGA) and an architecture-informed importance sampling heuristic ($\theta$-IS) to stabilize gradients and improve convergence.
For more details, please see the [ICLR 2026 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RuYwbd5xYa).

`scrapl` currently contains a PyTorch implementation of the SCRAPL algorithm for the [joint time–frequency scattering transform (JTFS)](https://www.kymat.io/ismir23-tutorial/ch1_intro/why_wavelets.html), which demodulates spectrotemporal patterns at multiple scales and rates, and has been shown to correlate with human perception ([Lostanlen et al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13636-020-00187-z); [Tian et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.07764)).
In our experiments, we find that SCRAPL accomplishes a favorable tradeoff between goodness of fit and computational efficiency on unsupervised sound matching, i.e., a nonlinear inverse problem in which the forward operator implements an audio synthesizer.
In the context of differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), the state-of-the-art perceptual loss function for this task is multiscale spectral loss (MSS, [Yamamoto et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1910.11480); [Engel et al., 2020](https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1x1ma4tDr)). 
However, the gradient of MSS is uninformative when input and reconstruction are misaligned or when the synthesizer controls involve spectrotemporal modulations ([Vahidi et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.10183)). 
Taking advantage of the stability guarantees of JTFS, SCRAPL expands the class of synthesizers which can be effectively decoded via DDSP.

Additional scattering transform implementations and support for other machine learning frameworks (e.g. JAX) may be added to `scrapl` in the future.

Both axes are rescaled by the performance of a supervised model with the same number of parameters. 
Whiskers denote 95% CI, estimated over 20 random seeds. Due to computational limitations, 
JTFS-based sound matching is evaluated only once._
